The Factory Simulation

Imagine a factory that has a number of stations. Each day, work
proceeds through
the stations.
The stations have high variability but are balanced. We simulate
this with a six
sided die. Users enter the number of stations and days and the
application shows
how work processes. The advanced version, factory_multi3.rb allows you to simulate
multiple runs of the factory (run it a thousand times and take
the averages) or
change the number of dice.
## Dependencies
This code developed and tested under ruby 2.0.0p247. As long as
you have ruby 1.9.3
or higher you should be fine.
## Running the Simulation
1. `cd this/project/directory`
2. `ruby factory.rb` or `ruby factory_multi3.rb`
## Running the Tests
